The EHDEN HMB study aims to answer the following questions:

-   What are the characteristics of women diagnosed with HMB in terms of demographics, comorbidities, procedures, and comedication?

-   What are the treatment pathways of women diagnosed with HMB?

-   What is the incidence of HMB across different countries and data sources?

The primary objectives of this study are:

1.  To characterize women of reproductive age diagnosed with a diagnosis of HMB (demographics, parity and reproductive history, comorbidities, comedications and procedures). **[see Clinical Characteristics and Underlying Conditions tabs]**

2.  To describe treatment pathways of women of reproductive age diagnosed with HMB across different countries and data sources (duration of use, switch to other/s treatment). **[see Treatment Patterns & Procedure Analysis tabs]**

The exploratory objectives of this study are:

3.  To describe the incidence and proportion of women diagnosed with HMB (calendar year over study period: 2000-2020). **[see Incidence tab]**

4.  To describe country-specific guideline compliant treatment use where national treatment guidelines are available for HMB. **[see Treatment Patterns & Procedure Analysis tabs]**
